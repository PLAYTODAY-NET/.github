#Hi there and thank you for visiting our Github page!

The PLAYTODAY.NET network offers a large variety of custom minigames, from which rewards can be earned. As a player you're able to sell and trade these rewards with others, or simply keep them to yourself. From the hub, besides the minigames, you also have access to a single survival world. Having a survival world doesn't really fit in with the "arcade" theme we were going for, but we figured it wouldn't hurt to give players an additional place to spend their minigame earnings.

We hope to see you soon!
